# 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
'''
Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. 
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and 
returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

import heapq


class KthLargest(object):

    def __init__(self, k, nums):
        """
        :type k: int
        :type nums: List[int]
        """
        self.k = k
        self.heap = nums
        heapq.heapify(self.heap)

    def add(self, val):
        """
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)
        while len(self.heap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        return self.heap[0]


# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
